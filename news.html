Biden endorses Kamala Harris
In a follow-up post on X , Biden then endorsed VP Kamala Harris as presidential nominee.
"My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this," said Biden on X.

        <td colspan="2"> <img src="sucide.jpg" alt=""><h2>Panel seeks urgent steps for weaver uplift</h2><br> NEW DELHI: In the light of a spate of suicide by weavers, a parliamentary panel has urged the government to take urgent steps for their welfare.
The Standing Committee on Labour led by CPI's S Sudhakar Reddy, which visited Sircilla in Andhra Pradesh where 23 weavers committed suicide in September and October, has in its report strongly recommended the setting up of a "handloom bank" on the pattern of Nabard and Sidbi.
It has also called for immediate setting up of "specialised branches in the highly concentrated zones of weavers from among nationalised cooperative banks" to provide soft loans to weavers. Since Parliament is not in session, the Standing Committee submitted its report to Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee on Wednesday.
It noted that large sums spent by governments on welfare schemes were not reaching the weavers. "This was evident by the extreme distraught condition of weavers," Reddy said. The panel, therefore, suggested setting up a "high level committee to evaluate the performance of all existing schemes" and recommended other steps to protect the interests of an estimated 1.20 crore weavers in both handloom and powerloom sectors.

            Can a global recession be predicted?<br>
             
            <p><b>Recession astrologist:</b> Economist Nouriel Roubini had correctly predicted the 2008 financial crisis when the economy in the US and elsewhere was booming.
            New prediction: Roubini sees a "long and ugly" recession occurring at the end of 2022, lasting all of 2023, with the S&P 500 undergoing a sharp correction, said a Bloomberg report quoting his upcoming book, "MegaThreats”.
            Dr Doom, as Roubini is nicknamed, has warned those playing down the economic crash fears in the US as “shallow recession”, pointing to large debt ratios of corporations and governments. He says "many zombie institutions, zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks and zombie countries are going to die".
            More rate hikes in the US: Roubini expects about 175 bas While the common households and banks were hardest hit during the 2008 crisis, Roubini says corporations and shadow banks — hedge funds, private equity and credit funds —- "are going to implode" this time around.</p>
